            <p>The snowman, was a jolly happy soul. Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose. Grandma got run over by a reindeer, walking home from our house Christmas eve. Rocking around the Christmas Tree at the Christmas party hop. How are thy leaves so verdant! Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that?</p>

            <article>"No, for three reasons: A, I'm not that lucky. Two, we use smoke detectors and D, we live on the most boring street in the whole United States of America, where nothing even remotely dangerous will ever happen. Period." </article><img src="images/Buzz.jpg" width="55px" />

            <article>"They sit there and use subliminal messages to suck your children's' minds out! And I know what I'm talking about because I went to junior college for a semester and I studied psychology so I'm right in there, I know what's going on. They make the kids feel like garbage and you, the father, who's working 24/7 delivering mail so you can make an alimony payment to a woman that slept with everybody at the post office, but me! And then when you get the toy, it breaks and you can't fix it because it's little cheap plastic!"</article><img src="images/myron.jpg" width="55px" />

            <article>“Where do you think you’re going? Nobody’s leaving. Nobody’s walking out on this fun, old-fashioned family Christmas. No, no. We’re all in this together. This is a full-blown, four-alarm holiday emergency here. We’re gonna press on, and we’re gonna have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny fucking Kaye. And when Santa squeezes his fat white ass down that chimney tonight, he’s gonna find the jolliest bunch of assholes this side of the nuthouse.” </article><img src="images/clark.jpg" width="55px" />
